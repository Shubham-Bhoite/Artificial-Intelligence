### Problem formulation is the process of defining a problem in a way that can be solved using computational methods. It involves identifying the relevant variables, constraints, and goals of the problem, and defining them in a way that can be processed by an AI system.

### Types of problem formulation

#### Incremental Formulation: 
  - In incremental formulation, a problem is broken down into a series of smaller sub-problems or stages, and each sub-problem is solved separately. The solutions to each sub-problem are then combined to find the overall solution to the problem. Incremental formulation is often used in dynamic or uncertain domains, where the problem changes over time and the solution must be updated accordingly. Examples of incremental formulation problems include robotics, where a robot must navigate through an environment and make decisions based on changing sensory input.

#### Complete State Formulation: 
  - In complete state formulation, the problem is defined in terms of a complete state, which includes all relevant information about the problem at a given point in time. The solution to the problem is then found by determining the sequence of actions that will transform the current state into the desired state. Complete state formulation is often used in well-structured problems, such as puzzles or games, where the solution can be found by exploring all possible states of the problem. Examples of complete state formulation problems include chess or Rubik's cube, where the objective is to find the sequence of moves that will lead to a winning state.
