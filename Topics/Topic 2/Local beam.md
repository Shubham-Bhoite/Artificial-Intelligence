### Local beam search:
A Local Beam Search is a variant of the traditional beam search algorithm, which is used in solving optimization problems. It is a heuristic search algorithm that starts with a set of randomly generated solutions and iteratively improves them by exploring the neighborhood of the current solutions. The algorithm maintains a fixed number of solutions, known as the beam width, and chooses the best solutions from the neighborhood of each of the current solutions. This process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found.

#### Algorithm:

  - Initialize the beam with k randomly generated solutions.
  - Repeat until a satisfactory solution is found:
    - a. For each solution s in the beam, generate all its neighbors.
    - b. Select the k best solutions from the union of the current beam and the set of all neighbors.
    - c. Replace the current beam with the k selected solutions.


#### Performance Evaluation:
The performance of the local beam search algorithm depends on various factors, such as the size of the problem, the choice of the beam width, and the quality of the initial solutions. In general, a larger beam width will increase the likelihood of finding better solutions, but it will also increase the computational complexity of the algorithm. On the other hand, a smaller beam width will decrease the computational complexity but may result in suboptimal solutions.
