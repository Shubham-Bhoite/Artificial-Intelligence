### Best-First Search:
Best-first search is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide the search and prioritize the most promising paths. The heuristic function estimates the cost of reaching the goal state from each possible state, and the algorithm chooses the path with the lowest estimated cost. Best-first search can be used in both single-agent and multi-agent settings.
#### Algorithm:

  - Initialize the search with the initial state
  - Generate the possible next states from the current state
  - Calculate the heuristic value for each possible next state
  - Choose the next state with the lowest heuristic value
  - Repeat steps 2-4 until the goal state is reached or no more states can be generated



#### Performance Evaluation:
Best-first search has a better performance than uninformed search algorithms such as depth-first search and breadth-first search. However, it can be less efficient than more complex informed search algorithms such as A* search, as it does not take into account the cost of reaching the current state.
