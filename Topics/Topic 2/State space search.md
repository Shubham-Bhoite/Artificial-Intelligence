### State space search

State-first search is a type of search algorithm used in artificial intelligence and computer science to explore a problem space by generating and testing candidate solutions. In state-first search, the problem is represented as a set of states, and the algorithm searches for a path from the initial state to a goal state.


#### Construction
  - Define the problem space: 
     The problem space is defined by the set of possible states that the problem can be in. This involves defining the initial state, the goal state, and the set of possible actions that can be taken to transition from one state to another.

  - Generate the search tree: 
    - The search tree is a data structure that represents the problem space and the possible paths from the initial state to the goal state. The search tree is generated by applying the possible actions to the initial state to generate new states, and adding these new states to the tree.

  - Perform state expansion: 
     - State expansion involves exploring the search tree by expanding the current state to generate new states. This involves applying the possible actions to the current state, and adding the resulting states to the search tree.

  - Check for goal state: 
     - At each step of the search, the algorithm checks if the current state is the goal state. If it is, the algorithm terminates and returns the path from the initial state to the goal state.

  - Repeat until goal state is found: 
     - The state-first search algorithm continues to expand states and generate new paths until the goal state is found, or until all possible paths have been explored.
