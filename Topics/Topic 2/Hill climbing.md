### Hill Climbing Search:
Hill Climbing is a local search algorithm that starts with an initial solution and iteratively makes small incremental improvements until a better solution is found or a local maxima is reached. The algorithm selects the best neighboring solution and compares it with the current solution. If the neighboring solution is better, it becomes the current solution, and the process continues until no better solution can be found.


#### Algorithm:

  - Initialize the current solution
  - Repeat the following steps until no better solution can be found:
   - a. Generate all neighboring solutions
   - b. Evaluate the quality of each neighboring solution
   - c. Select the best neighboring solution
   - d. If the best neighboring solution is better than the current solution, update the current solution to the best neighboring solution
   - e. Otherwise, terminate and return the current solution


#### Performance Evaluation:
Hill Climbing is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm that can quickly find good solutions for small problems. However, it can get stuck in local optima, which makes it unsuitable for large and complex problems.
