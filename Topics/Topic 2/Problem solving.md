### Problem Solving
Problem solving is a fundamental aspect of AI, as it is a process of finding solutions to complex problems through various methods and techniques. AI systems are designed to solve problems in a variety of domains, such as natural language processing, image recognition, and decision-making.
#### Representation: 
  - AI systems represent problems and solutions in a way that can be processed by machines. For example, in natural language processing, a problem can be represented as a text input, and the solution can be represented as a set of actions that the AI system needs to take.

#### Search: 
  - AI systems use search algorithms to find the best solution to a problem. These algorithms can be simple, like brute force search, or more complex, like heuristic search, which uses domain-specific knowledge to guide the search.

#### Reasoning: 
  - AI systems use logical reasoning to draw conclusions from available information. For example, in a diagnostic system, the AI system may use a set of rules to determine the cause of a patient's symptoms.

#### Optimization: 
  - AI systems use optimization algorithms to find the best solution to a problem given a set of constraints. For example, in a scheduling system, the AI system may use an optimization algorithm to schedule tasks in a way that minimizes the overall time or cost.
