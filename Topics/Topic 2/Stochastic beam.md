### Stochastic Beam Search:
Stochastic Beam Search is a variant of Beam Search that randomly selects a subset of the best solutions to explore in the next iteration. The algorithm generates k random initial solutions and evaluates their quality. In each iteration, it selects the best m solutions among the k solutions and randomly selects k new solutions from the neighborhood of the best m solutions.


#### Algorithm:

  - Initialize k random solutions
  - Repeat the following steps until no better solution can be found:
    - a. Evaluate the quality of each solution
    - b. Select the best m solutions among the k solutions
    - c. Generate all neighboring solutions of the best m solutions
    - d. Randomly select k new solutions from the neighboring solutions
    - e. If the best new solution is better than the current solution, update the current solution to the best new solution
    - f. Otherwise, terminate and return the current solution


#### Performance Evaluation:
Stochastic Beam Search can overcome the local optima problem by randomly exploring the search space. It can generate diverse solutions and quickly converge to a good solution. However, it requires more computational resources than Hill Climbing and Greedy Local Search, and the performance can be highly dependent on the number of initial solutions k and the number of best solutions to select m.
