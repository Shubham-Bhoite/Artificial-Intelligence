### AO* Algorithm:
AO* is an extension of the A* algorithm that uses an adaptive heuristic function that is updated during the search. The idea behind AO* is to improve the heuristic function over time by incorporating the actual cost of reaching each node during the search.

#### Algorithm:

  - Initialize open and closed sets with the start node as the only member of the open set.
  - While the open set is not empty, select the node with the lowest f(n) value, where f(n) = g(n) + h(n) and g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n, and h(n) is the adaptive heuristic estimate of the cost from n to the goal.
  - If the selected node is the goal node, then return the path to the goal.
  - For each successor of the selected node, calculate its g value, and update the adaptive heuristic function using the actual cost of reaching the successor.
  - If the new adaptive heuristic estimate is lower than the previous one, add the successor to the open set with the updated h value.
  - Move the selected node from the open set to the closed set.



#### Performance Evaluation:
AO* algorithm can converge faster than A* because it updates the heuristic function during the search. AO* is also complete, optimal, and admissible like A*, and it can handle cases where the heuristic is not informative or inconsistent. However, AO* can be computationally expensive because it requires updating the heuristic function after each expansion, and it may converge to a suboptimal solution if the heuristic function is not accurate enough.
