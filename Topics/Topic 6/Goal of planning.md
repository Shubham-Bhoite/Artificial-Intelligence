### Goal of planning

- The goal of planning is to generate a sequence of actions or a plan that enables an agent to achieve its desired objectives or goals in a given environment or problem domain. Planning involves reasoning about the current state of the world, determining the actions needed to reach the desired state, and constructing a coherent and executable plan.

- The primary objectives of planning 

  1. Goal Achievement:
     The fundamental goal of planning is to enable an agent to achieve its desired goals or objectives. This involves identifying the desired end state or states and determining the sequence of actions necessary to reach those states.

  2. Problem Solving:
     Planning is often employed as a problem-solving technique to overcome obstacles, find solutions, or achieve specific outcomes. It allows an agent to analyze a problem, break it down into manageable sub-goals, and generate a plan that solves the problem step-by-step.

  3. Efficiency and Optimality:
     Planning aims to find efficient or optimal solutions by considering resource constraints, minimizing costs, or maximizing rewards. Planning algorithms seek to generate plans that achieve the goals in the most efficient or effective manner possible, given the available resources and constraints.

  4. Adaptability and Flexibility:
     Planning provides agents with the ability to adapt and respond to changes in the environment or the problem domain. It allows agents to generate alternative plans or modify existing plans when new information or circumstances arise, enabling them to handle dynamic or uncertain situations.

  5. Decision Support:
     Planning serves as a decision support tool by assisting agents in making informed choices and selecting actions based on their goals. It helps agents evaluate the consequences and trade-offs associated with different actions and select the most suitable course of action to achieve their objectives.

  6. Coherence and Consistency:
     Planning ensures that the sequence of actions in a plan is coherent and consistent, considering the dependencies, preconditions, and effects of each action. A well-constructed plan maintains the logical and temporal relationships between actions, ensuring that they can be executed in a meaningful and valid order.
