### Multi agent planning
- Multi-agent planning involves the coordination and cooperation of multiple autonomous agents to achieve common goals or solve complex problems. It extends the traditional planning framework to handle scenarios where multiple agents interact, have their own goals, and may have overlapping or conflicting actions. Here are some key points to note about multi-agent planning:

1. Cooperative vs. Competitive Scenarios:
   Multi-agent planning can occur in cooperative or competitive settings. In cooperative scenarios, agents collaborate and coordinate their actions to achieve shared goals. In competitive scenarios, agents may have conflicting goals and can strategically plan their actions to outperform other agents.

2. Communication and Coordination:
   Multi-agent planning often requires agents to communicate and exchange information to achieve coordination. Agents may need to share their knowledge, intentions, and plans with each other to avoid conflicts, synchronize their actions, or form coalitions to accomplish shared objectives.

3. Inter-agent Dependencies:
   In multi-agent planning, actions and plans of one agent can have dependencies or effects on the actions and plans of other agents. Agents must consider these dependencies and potential interferences when generating plans to ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts between agents.

4. Decentralized vs. Centralized Planning:
   Multi-agent planning can be approached in a centralized or decentralized manner. In centralized planning, a central planner or authority coordinates the actions of all agents, generating a global plan for the team. In decentralized planning, each agent independently generates its own plan based on local knowledge, communication, and coordination with other agents.

5. Plan Coordination and Integration:
   Multi-agent planning requires mechanisms to coordinate and integrate individual agents' plans into a coherent overall plan. This involves resolving conflicts, reconciling overlapping actions, synchronizing actions, and ensuring that the combined plans of all agents contribute to achieving the shared objectives.

6. Coalition Formation:
   In some multi-agent planning scenarios, agents can form coalitions or teams to collaboratively pursue common goals. Coalition formation involves selecting a subset of agents and coordinating their actions to maximize collective performance or achieve joint objectives. This may involve negotiation, bargaining, or agreement protocols among agents.

7. Dynamic Environments:
   Multi-agent planning must account for dynamic environments where the state of the world or the behavior of other agents may change over time. Agents need to be able to adapt their plans and actions based on the evolving situation and handle uncertainties and partial information effectively.

8. Complexity and Scalability:
   Multi-agent planning can introduce significant complexity due to the increased number of agents, interactions, and dependencies. Planning algorithms for multi-agent systems must address scalability concerns and find efficient solutions in large-scale environments with multiple agents and complex interdependencies.
