### Simple planning agent

- A simple planning agent is an autonomous agent that employs a basic planning process to achieve its goals. It operates in a dynamic environment, receives perceptual information, generates a plan, and executes actions to bring about the desired outcomes. While simple planning agents lack sophisticated reasoning capabilities, they follow a straightforward cycle of perceiving, planning, and acting to achieve their objectives.

#### Components of a Simple Planning Agent:

1. Perceptual System:
   The perceptual system of a simple planning agent gathers information about the current state of the environment. It receives sensor inputs or observations and updates the internal representation of the world accordingly. The perceptual system provides the agent with the necessary data to reason about the current situation and make informed decisions.

2. Goal Formulation:
   The goal formulation component defines the agent's objectives. It specifies the desired state or outcome that the agent aims to achieve. Goals can be explicitly provided or generated based on the agent's internal state and external inputs. The agent needs clear and well-defined goals to guide its planning and action selection.

3. Planning:
   The planning component is responsible for generating a sequence of actions or a plan that, when executed, will lead to the achievement of the agent's goals. The planning process typically involves searching through possible action sequences, evaluating their feasibility and expected outcomes, and selecting the most promising plan based on some predefined criteria.

4. Action Selection:
   The action selection component chooses the next action to execute based on the current state of the environment and the generated plan. It considers the agent's internal representation of the world, the goals, and the available actions. The action selection process determines which action to perform at a given time to progress towards the desired state.

5. Execution and Control:
   The execution and control component is responsible for carrying out the selected action and monitoring its effects. It interacts with the environment, updates the agent's internal state based on the action's outcome, and perceives the environment's response. The execution and control component ensures that the agent's actions are performed correctly and manages any necessary adjustments or adaptations during execution.

6. Learning and Adaptation (optional):
   Some simple planning agents may incorporate learning and adaptation mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the agent to improve its planning process or modify its behavior based on past experiences, feedback, or changes in the environment. Learning can help the agent refine its plans, adjust its goals, or optimize its decision-making.
