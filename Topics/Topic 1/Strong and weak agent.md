### Strong agent
A strong agent is an agent that is capable of achieving a wide range of goals in complex and dynamic environments. It has a high degree of intelligence and can adapt to changing circumstances and new tasks without significant intervention from its human operators. Strong agents are often associated with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to a hypothetical form of AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.


### Weak agent
A weak agent is an agent that is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks in a narrow domain. It has a lower degree of intelligence and is less capable of adapting to new situations or tasks outside of its intended purpose. Weak agents are also known as artificial narrow intelligence (ANI).
