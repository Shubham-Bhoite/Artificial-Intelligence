### History of AI

- 1943: McCulloch and Pitts propose a model of an artificial neuron, which is the basis for neural networks.

- 1950: Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test, a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human.

- 1956: The Dartmouth Conference marks the birth of AI as a field of research. The conference was attended by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and other pioneers of AI.

- 1958: John McCarthy invents LISP, a programming language used for AI research.

- 1961: The first AI program to play chess is written by Dietrich Prinz.

- 1966: The ELIZA program, a natural language processing program that simulates conversation, is developed by Joseph Weizenbaum.

- 1969: Shakey, the first mobile robot, is developed at Stanford Research Institute.

- 1970s-1980s: The development of expert systems, which use knowledge-based rules to solve complex problems in specific domains.

- 1990s: The development of machine learning algorithms, which enable machines to learn from data and improve performance over time.

- 2010s: The emergence of deep learning, a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data and achieve state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.
