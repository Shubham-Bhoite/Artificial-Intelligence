### Environment
The environment refers to the external context in which an agent operates. An environment can be physical or virtual and is defined by the set of states, actions, and rewards that an agent can perceive and interact with.

### Types of Environment


  - Fully observable environment: In this type of environment, the agent can directly observe the complete state of the environment at each time step.

  - Partially observable environment: In this type of environment, the agent cannot directly observe the complete state of the environment, but must infer it from the observations it receives through its sensors.

  - Deterministic environment: In this type of environment, the outcome of an agent's actions is completely predictable and does not involve any randomness or uncertainty.

  - Stochastic environment: In this type of environment, the outcome of an agent's actions involves some degree of randomness or uncertainty.

  - Episodic environment: In this type of environment, the agent's experience is divided into a sequence of discrete episodes, where each episode consists of a sequence of actions, observations, and rewards.

  - Sequential environment: In this type of environment, the agent's experience is a continuous sequence of actions, observations, and rewards that are interdependent and can influence future outcomes.
