In AI, an agent is a software or hardware entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve a specific goal. An agent can be thought of as a decision maker that interacts with its environment through sensors and actuators.


### Example of agent
 A self-driving car can be considered an agent because it perceives its environment through sensors such as cameras and lidar, and takes actions such as steering and accelerating to reach its destination.


### Types of Agent
There are various types of agent architectures, but most of them share the following components:

  - Perception: This component allows the agent to sense its environment through sensors such as cameras, microphones, and other sensors.

  - Reasoning: This component allows the agent to reason about its environment and make decisions based on that information.

  - Action: This component allows the agent to take actions in the environment through actuators such as motors, speakers, and other effectors.

  - Learning: This component allows the agent to learn from its experiences and improve its performance over time.


### Role of agent
The role of an agent in AI is to solve problems in complex and dynamic environments. By perceiving its environment, reasoning about the information it receives, and taking actions to achieve a specific goal, an agent can solve problems that would be difficult or impossible for humans to solve alone.
