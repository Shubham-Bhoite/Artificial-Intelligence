### PEAS
  PEAS is an acronym that stands for Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. It is a framework used in AI to help define the properties and requirements of an intelligent agent.
  
  ### Performance measure:
This refers to the objective that the agent is trying to achieve. The performance measure is used to evaluate the success of the agent and can be defined in various ways. For example, it could be a measure of efficiency, accuracy, or profitability, depending on the task and goals of the agent.
  - Example: In a game of chess, the performance measure could be the number of pieces captured, the number of checkmates achieved, or the time taken to win the game.

  ### Environment:
This refers to the external context in which the agent operates, including the objects, events, and conditions that the agent can perceive and interact with. The environment can be static or dynamic, deterministic or stochastic, and can have various degrees of complexity.
  - Example: In a self-driving car, the environment includes the road, traffic lights, other vehicles, pedestrians, weather conditions, and various obstacles.

  ### Actuators:
This refers to the physical devices or mechanisms that the agent uses to interact with the environment and perform actions. Actuators can include motors, valves, grippers, screens, and other output devices.
  - Example: In a robot that cleans floors, the actuators could include wheels, brushes, and a vacuum pump that are used to move the robot and collect dirt.

  ### Sensors:
This refers to the physical devices or mechanisms that the agent uses to sense the state of the environment and collect information. Sensors can include cameras, microphones, sonars, touch sensors, and other input devices.
  - Example: In a smart thermostat, the sensors could include temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and motion sensors that are used to detect the presence and behavior of occupants.
