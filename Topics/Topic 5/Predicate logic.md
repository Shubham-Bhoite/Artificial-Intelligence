### Predicate logic
- Predicate logic, also known as first-order logic, is a formal system used for reasoning about relationships between objects and making logical deductions. It extends propositional logic by introducing variables, quantifiers, and predicates.

- In predicate logic, we use predicates to describe properties or relations between objects. Predicates are functions or relations that take one or more arguments and return a truth value (true or false) based on those arguments. We denote predicates using uppercase letters and use lowercase letters for variables.

#### Example 1:-

- Statement: "All cats are mammals."

- In predicate logic, we can express this statement using a predicate, let's say "Cat(x)" to represent the property of being a cat, and another predicate "Mammal(x)" to represent the property of being a mammal. Here, 'x' is a variable that can take on different values.

- We can express the statement using the universal quantifier (∀) as follows:

- ∀x (Cat(x) → Mammal(x))

- This statement reads as "For all x, if x is a cat, then x is a mammal." The universal quantifier (∀) indicates that the statement holds for all possible values of x.

#### Example 2:-

- Statement: "There exists a student who loves mathematics."

- In this case, we can use a predicate "Student(x)" to represent the property of being a student and another predicate "LovesMathematics(x)" to represent the property of loving mathematics. Again, 'x' is a variable that can take on different values.

- We can express the statement using the existential quantifier (∃) as follows:

- ∃x (Student(x) ∧ LovesMathematics(x))

- This statement reads as "There exists an x such that x is a student and x loves mathematics." The existential quantifier (∃) indicates that there exists at least one value of x that satisfies the statement.
