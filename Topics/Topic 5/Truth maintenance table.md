### Truth maintenance table(TMT)

- A truth maintenance table (TMT) is a data structure used in knowledge-based systems to track the dependencies and support for beliefs or propositions. It is commonly employed in the context of non-monotonic reasoning to handle the revision and retraction of beliefs in the presence of new information. The TMT helps keep track of the consistency of beliefs and assists in maintaining a coherent knowledge base. 

#### Properties of a Truth Maintenance Table:

1. Dependency Tracking:
   - The TMT records the dependencies between beliefs or propositions in the knowledge base.
   - It tracks the support relationships between beliefs, allowing for efficient identification of beliefs affected by the introduction or removal of new information.

2. Justification Maintenance:
   - The TMT stores the justifications or reasons supporting each belief.
   - It keeps track of the evidence or rules that led to the acceptance of a belief, allowing for easy identification and examination of the supporting information.

3. Conflict Detection:
   - The TMT detects conflicts that arise when new information contradicts existing beliefs.
   - It enables the system to identify and handle inconsistent or contradictory beliefs, facilitating the resolution of conflicts through belief revision or retraction.

4. Efficient Belief Revision:
   - The TMT allows for efficient belief revision by identifying the beliefs that need to be revisited or modified when new information is added.
   - It minimizes the computational overhead by focusing on the beliefs affected by the changes, rather than reevaluating the entire knowledge base.

5. Coherence Maintenance:
   - The TMT helps maintain coherence and consistency in the knowledge base by facilitating the identification and resolution of inconsistent beliefs.
   - It allows for the detection of conflicts and supports the process of belief revision to ensure that the revised knowledge base remains coherent.

6. Incremental Reasoning:
   - The TMT supports incremental reasoning by efficiently updating the beliefs affected by new information without reevaluating the entire knowledge base.
   - It enables the system to incrementally revise beliefs and update the support relationships based on the changes.

7. Traceability and Explanation:
   - The TMT provides traceability and explanation capabilities, allowing for the tracing of the lineage of beliefs and the identification of the supporting evidence.
   - It aids in providing explanations for the acceptance or rejection of beliefs, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning process.
