### Non-monotonic reasoning
- Non-monotonic reasoning is a form of reasoning where conclusions can be revised or modified when new information becomes available. Unlike classical or monotonic reasoning, which follows the principle of deductive logic where new information only adds to the existing knowledge without contradiction, non-monotonic reasoning allows for revising or retracting previously made conclusions in the face of new evidence or exceptions.

### Types of Non-monotonic Reasoning:

1. Default Reasoning:
   - Default reasoning involves making assumptions or default rules that hold true in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
   - Default rules are used to derive conclusions that are likely or typically true but can be overridden if there is evidence to the contrary.
   - Example: In a default reasoning system, if someone says, "Birds can fly," it is assumed that most birds can fly. However, if someone provides evidence of a flightless bird like an ostrich, the initial assumption can be revised.

2. Autoepistemic Reasoning:
   - Autoepistemic reasoning deals with reasoning about one's own beliefs or knowledge states.
   - It allows for introspection and reasoning about the consistency or inconsistency of one's own beliefs.
   - Example: In autoepistemic reasoning, if someone initially believes that "If it is raining, then the ground is wet," but later discovers that the ground is dry despite the rain, they may revise their belief about the relationship between rain and wet ground.

3. Abductive Reasoning:
   - Abductive reasoning involves generating plausible explanations or hypotheses to explain observed facts or phenomena.
   - It involves inferring the most likely explanation based on the available evidence, even if it is not guaranteed to be true.
   - Example: In abductive reasoning, if a person observes dark clouds, feels a drop of water, and hears distant thunder, they may abduce the hypothesis that it is going to rain.

4. Circumscription:
   - Circumscription is a form of non-monotonic reasoning that involves minimizing the number of assumptions needed to explain a given set of facts.
   - It aims to find the most concise or minimal explanation for a given situation.
   - Example: In circumscription, if someone observes that all birds they have encountered so far can fly, they may circumscribe the assumption that "all birds can fly" to minimize the set of assumptions needed to explain the observed facts.

5. Default Logic:
   - Default logic extends classical logic by allowing for exceptions to general rules or assumptions.
   - It uses default rules that provide a default conclusion unless there is evidence to override it.
   - Example: In default logic, a default rule may state that "If a person is a student, they are likely to be under 25 years old." However, if a person is a known exception to this rule (e.g., a mature student), the default conclusion can be overridden.
