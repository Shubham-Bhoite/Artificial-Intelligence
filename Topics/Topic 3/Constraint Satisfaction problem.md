### Constraint Satisfaction problem

- A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a computational problem defined by a set of variables, a domain of values for each variable, and a set of constraints that determine the valid combinations of values for the variables. The goal of a CSP is to find an assignment of values to the variables that satisfies all the given constraints.

- The variables in a CSP represent the unknowns or quantities to be determined, and the domains specify the possible values that each variable can take. The constraints define the relationships or conditions that must hold between the variables' values.

- The key challenge in solving a CSP is to find a consistent assignment of values to the variables that satisfies all the constraints. A consistent assignment means that no constraint is violated, and all the variables have a valid value from their respective domains.

- CSPs have a wide range of applications in various fields, including artificial intelligence, operations research, scheduling, resource allocation, and configuration problems. They provide a formal framework for representing and solving problems with discrete variables and complex interdependencies.

- Common algorithms used to solve CSPs include backtracking, constraint propagation, and local search methods. These algorithms systematically explore the search space of possible variable assignments while considering the constraints to find a valid solution or determine that no solution exists.
