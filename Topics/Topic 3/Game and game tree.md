### Game and Game tree

- A game is a structured interaction between two or more players, where each player tries to achieve a goal by making decisions. Games can be played for fun, competition, or learning.

- A game tree is a mathematical model of a game. It is a tree-like structure where each node represents a possible state of the game, and each edge represents a possible move. The game tree starts with the initial state of the game, and branches out to represent all possible future states of the game. The game ends when a leaf node is reached, which represents a terminal state of the game.

- Game trees can be used to analyze games, to develop game-playing strategies, and to simulate games. They are a powerful tool for understanding and playing games.

### Here are some examples of games and their corresponding game trees:

- Tic-tac-toe: The game tree for tic-tac-toe is very small, with only 16 possible terminal states. This makes it easy to analyze and develop strategies for the game.
- Chess: The game tree for chess is much larger than the game tree for tic-tac-toe, with over 10^120 possible terminal states. This makes it impossible to analyze the entire game tree, but game-playing algorithms can be used to search the tree for promising moves.
- Go: The game tree for Go is even larger than the game tree for chess, with over 10^170 possible terminal states. This makes it even more difficult to analyze the entire game tree, but game-playing algorithms can still be used to search the tree for promising moves.
