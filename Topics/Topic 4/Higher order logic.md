### Higher-order Logic:
- Higher-order logic (HOL), on the other hand, is a more formal and well-defined logic that allows for quantification over functions, predicates, and relations, going beyond second-order logic. It provides a powerful framework for expressing and reasoning about higher-level concepts in mathematics and logic.

- In higher-order logic, variables can represent not only objects but also functions, predicates, or relations. Quantification can be performed over these higher-order entities, allowing statements to express properties or relationships involving functions or relations.

#### Example:
Let's consider the statement: "For all functions f, there exists an element x such that f(x) = x." In higher-order logic, we can represent it as:
∀f ∃x (f(x) = x)
Here, "f" represents a function, and the statement asserts that for every function "f," there exists an element "x" for which the function "f" maps to itself.
