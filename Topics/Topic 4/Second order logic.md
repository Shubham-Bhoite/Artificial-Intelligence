### Second-Order Logic (SOL):
- Second-order logic extends FOL by allowing quantification over relations and functions in addition to objects. It provides a more expressive framework to reason about properties of collections of objects or relations between relations.

#### Example:
In second-order logic, we can express the statement: "There exists a relation R such that for all x and y, if R(x, y), then R(y, x)." This can be represented as:
∃R ∀x ∀y (R(x, y) → R(y, x))
Here, "R(x, y)" represents a binary relation between objects x and y. The existence quantifier (∃R) indicates the existence of a relation R that satisfies the statement.
