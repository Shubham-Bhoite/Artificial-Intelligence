### Third-order Logic:
- Third-order logic is an informal term that refers to logics where quantification is extended to include predicates or relations over predicates (second-order entities). It allows for reasoning about properties of properties or relations between relations.

#### Example:
Consider the statement:
"For all binary relations R and S, if R is symmetric and S is transitive, then R ∘ S is reflexive." Here, R and S represent binary relations, and R ∘ S represents the composition of R and S. In third-order logic, we can reason about the properties of R and S and their relationship with the composition operation.
