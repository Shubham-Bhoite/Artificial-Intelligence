### First-Order Logic (FOL):
- First-order logic is a formal system used to represent and reason about objects, properties, and relations. It introduces variables, quantifiers, and predicates to enable more expressive statements compared to propositional logic.

- In FOL, variables are placeholders that can take on specific values or objects. Quantifiers, such as universal quantifier (∀) and existential quantifier (∃), are used to express statements that apply to all or some objects, respectively. Predicates are used to describe properties or relations between objects.

- FOL allows for the construction of complex statements using logical connectives like conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨), implication (→), and negation (¬). It also provides equality (=) for comparing objects.

#### Example:
Consider the statement: "For all x, if x is a person, then x has a mother." In FOL, we can represent it as:
∀x (Person(x) → HasMother(x))
Here, "Person(x)" is a predicate that represents x being a person, and "HasMother(x)" represents x having a mother. The universal quantifier (∀x) indicates that the statement applies to all objects x.
